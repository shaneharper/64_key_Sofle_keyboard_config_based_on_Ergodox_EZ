This is a [Vial](https://get.vial.today/) keyboard configuration for a [64-key Sofle split keyboard](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005009030569720.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.72.2d171802b81KJR) based on the default configuration of an [ErgoDox EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com/) keyboard.


## Key differences

- The 64-key Sofle has twelve fewer keys than an ErgoDox EZ.<br>
  I rarely used the missing keys. The base layer no longer includes:
    - `Home`, `End`, `PageUp`, and `PageDown` in the thumb clusters.<br>
      *These have been moved to layer 1.*
    - An "extra" `backspace` key.<br>
      *Backspace for the left thumb remains; there is no longer a backspace key in the leftmost column (that key will now change to layer 1).*
    - "Extra" keys to change to layer 1.<br>
    - "Extra" right and left arrow keys on the top row of the keyboard.
    - `Hyper` and `Meh`.
- The `[` and `]` keys are (unfortunately) no longer on the bottom row.<br>
      *Brackets are assigned to some letter keys on layer 1 (as per the Ergodox EZ).*
- Keys to change screen brightness added to layer 2.
- Combos were defined.<br>
  Pressing `b` and `c` together will insert "`because `", `t` and `e` together will insert "`the`", etc.

### Why a 64-key Sofle?
It's a split ortholinear keyboard with multiple thumb keys.

#### Advantages over ErgoDox EZ
- Wireless version at a good price.<br>
  Moving the keyboard on and off my lap is easier when there aren't cables. While seated I like to have a keyboard on my lap. (I rest the two halves of the keyboard on a board.)
- Fewer keys.<br>
  There were keys on the ErgoDox EZ that I never used. Some thumb cluster keys were a bit hard to reach.
- Smaller, easier to transport.
